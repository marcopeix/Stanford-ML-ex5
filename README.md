In this exercise, the learning curve is introduced as a way to debug a machine learning model. It offers a good way to determine if a model has a high bias or a high variance.

The dataset concerns water flowing out of a dam. A linear model and a polynomial model are fit to the data, and regularization is implemented. For each, a scenario of high bias or high variance is forced in order to observe the learning curves.
